![Blunder Logo](lil_guy.png)

Blunder is a unique take on the classic game of chess, merging elements of a rogue-like game with strategic chess gameplay. Developed in Android Studio using Java, this app introduces exciting features that differentiate it from traditional chess.

## Key Features
1. Enemy Move-making Algorithm
Blunder incorporates a sophisticated algorithm to create challenging and diverse enemy moves, providing a dynamic gaming experience.

## 2. Endless Roguelike Experience
Engage in continuous rounds of chess until you meet your match! Each game ends with a loss, but the challenge lies in surviving as long as possible against increasingly difficult opponents.

## 3. Unique Rule Variations
Blunder introduces slight rule modifications:

### King's Fate: Unlike conventional chess, the game can be instantly won or lost by eliminating the King.
### Frog's Hop: Pawns have a unique "hop" feature, allowing them to traverse over pieces during their initial two-space movement.
4. Shop for Piece Redemption
After losing a match, players can use earned currency to buy back lost pieces from the shop, adding a strategic layer to subsequent games.

## 5. Leaderboard and Scoring
Compete for high scores on the leaderboard! Your rank is determined by a calculated score after each match, considering the number of surviving pieces and the total number of rounds played.

##Meet Gringus!
Gringus is the "friendly" shopkeep of Blunder, managing the in-game shop and reigning as the top player on the leaderboard. Interact with Gringus as you strategize your game!
