# EC327_OneChess
EC327_Final Project

One Chess is a Java-based mobile video game, which features the well known Chess gameplay, but with the twist of it being a rogue-like endless run of chess. The game features an AI algorithm, which will mercilessly play against the player, and make smart decisions in order to win the game against the player. The player, on the other hand, has the goal of beating the bot as many times as they possibly can, while their chess piece loss is permanent. The player's victories will be recorded, and they'll be able to have their data set onto a public leaderboard with the possibility to include their picture in there as well. At the end of every round, the player will be able to buy back their lost pieces, or buy abilities to help give them an edge in the next round. The amount of money they are given is based on the number of turns they took to beat the bot that previous game. The game will run until the player loses, after which the player will be able to set their username for the leaderboard, and input an image into there for a profile picture as well.
