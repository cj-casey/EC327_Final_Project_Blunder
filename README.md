# Blunder
EC327 Final Project
By Amado Diallo, Bogdan Sadikovic, Loren Moreira, Connor Casey

Blunder is a Java-based mobile video game, which features the well known Chess gameplay, but with the twist of it being a rogue-like endless run of chess. Since its an endless match The game features an enemy algorithm, which will mercilessly play against the player, and make decisions in order to win the game against the player. The player, on the other hand, has the goal of beating the bot as many times as they possibly can, while their chess piece loss is permanent. The player's victories will be recorded, and they'll be able to have their data set onto a public leaderboard with the possibility to include their picture in there as well. At the end of every round, the player will be able to buy back their lost pieces to help give them an edge in the next round. The amount of money they are given is based on the number of turns they took to beat the bot that previous game. The game will run until the player loses, after which the player will be able to set their username for the leaderboard, and input an image into there for a profile picture as well.

Blunder is a unique take on the classic game of chess, merging elements of a rogue-like game with strategic chess gameplay. Developed in Android Studio using Java, this app introduces exciting features that differentiate it from traditional chess.

Key Features
1. Enemy Move-making Algorithm
Blunder incorporates a sophisticated algorithm to create challenging and diverse enemy moves, providing a dynamic gaming experience.

2. Back-to-Back Rounds
Engage in continuous rounds of chess until you meet your match! Each game ends with a loss, but the challenge lies in surviving as long as possible against increasingly difficult opponents.

3. Unique Rule Variations
Blunder introduces slight rule modifications:

King's Fate: Unlike conventional chess, the game can be instantly won or lost by eliminating the King.
Pawns' Hop Ability: Pawns have a unique "hop" feature, allowing them to traverse over pieces during their initial two-space movement.
4. Shop for Piece Redemption
After losing a match, players can use earned currency to buy back lost pieces from the shop, adding a strategic layer to subsequent games.

5. Leaderboard and Scoring
Compete for high scores on the leaderboard! Your rank is determined by a calculated score after each match, considering the number of surviving pieces and the total number of rounds played.

Meet Gringus!
Gringus is the friendly mascot of Blunder, managing the in-game shop and reigning as the top player on the leaderboard. Interact with Gringus as you strategize your game!
